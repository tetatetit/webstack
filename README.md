# www_stack
Complete stack/server/environment (or even rather ifrastructure) for development/testing/production all at once based on official docker PHP (apache/fpm), MariaDB, #jwidler/nginx-proxy, with reasonable timeout and post size for web apps (for multiple web apps on same IP and port number but different domain), Zimbra-Community/zimbra-docker with some upconing tweaks.
